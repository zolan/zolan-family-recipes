When it comes to the top it is ready.  When you take it out cut it into 6 parts (it goes down from where it has risen).  Use quite a little bit of flour, and make each ball as near the same size as possible and knead each one.  Then roll and make crescents.  2 balls to each pan.  Grease the pans.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes.\n\nTo make crescents roll each piece in a circle, cut into 8 pie shaped pieces.  Put slices of cold butter or about 3/4 of a cube of margarine on each circle.  (I cut them first and put margarine on before I roll them.)  Roll up into crescents.\n\nFrom the kitchen of Lila McLean",
