powdered sugar glaze (below)
chopped nuts

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut 1/2 cup butter into 1 cup flour until particles are size of small peas.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of water over flour mixture.  Mix with fork.  Gather pastry into ball.  Divide into halves.  Pat each half into rectangle 12 x 13 ungreased cookie sheet.  Rectangles should be about 3 inches apart.  Heat 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup water to a rolling boil; remove from heat.  Quickly stir in almond extract and 1 cup flour.  Stir vigorously over low heat until mixture forms a ball.  About 1 minute.  Remove form heat. Add eggs and beat until smooth and glossy.  Spread half the topping over each rectangle.  Bake until topping is crisp and brown, about 1  hour.  Cool.  (topping will shrink and fall and form custard top)  Spread with powdered sugar glaze.  Sprinkle with nuts.  Makes 2 coffee cakes.
We do not recommend margarine for this recipe.

Powdered sugar glaze:

Mix  1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons butter (softened) and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. Stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons warm water, 1 tsp at a time until smooth and ready to spread.

Chocolate filled Danish Puff:
After patting pastry into rectangles sprinkle 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/4 cup chopped nuts on each rectangles to within 1/2 inch of edges.  Continue as directed except omit glaze.  After baking cool and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

This is so flaky and flavorful and yes it does come chocolate filled.  A challenge to make  the first time but gets easier the next time because there will be a next time because your family will ask for it again!
